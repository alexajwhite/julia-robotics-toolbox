# Julia Robotics Toolbox

This toolbox is a Julia port of Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox that was initially found on MATLAB at [this link.](https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-matlab/).  
The aim of this toolbox is to provide functions and tools that allow the ability to learn and play around with robotics components.   
The Julia port also contains a port of the Spatial Maths commands that are present at [this link](https://github.com/petercorke/spatialmath-matlab).  

The following sections of this toolbox are finished/ planned:
- Spatial Maths Toolbox (Almost complete, Plot fixes and additional testing required)
- Arm Robotics Components (Planned)
- Mobile Robotics Components(Planned)
